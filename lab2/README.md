# Lab 2

## Linked list
* [First implementation](https://github.com/AidXylelele/labs/commit/918e1d6c5206b32773b1aa79c38a5ad1be4fe720) is classic singly linked circular list.

* [Second implementation](https://github.com/kreslavskiy/methodologies-lab-2/blob/master/src/linkedListNode.ts) of the linked list based on built-in arrays.

## Calculation of variant
Defining variant formula: number of variant % 4
```
24 % 4 = 0
```

### Getting started

1. Clone repoitory via ```git clone https://github.com/AidXylelele/labs.git```
2. Install TypeScript Globally via ```npm install -g typescript```
3. Install node_modules in root folder ```labs``` via ```npm i```
5. Build all TypeScript files via ```npm run build```
6. Run app via ```npm run start-lab2```
7. Run ```npm run clean``` in root folder to delete build files

## Conclusion
While doing this lab work, I realised that unit testing is very important in the development of any application. It helps us to find bugs quickly at any stage of development and thereby helps us to save our time.
